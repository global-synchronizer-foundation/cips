# CIP 0038

## Summary

- Add Hexagate as a Tier3 SV (Weight 1)
- Hexagate commits to integrate Canton Coin with their real-time threat protection capabilities.

## Motivation

- Canton Coin is a decentralized utility coin that cannot be retrieved if stolen or lost.
- Ensuring a safe environment for using Canton Coin will engender greater trust in Canton Coin and increase usage.
- Assets, applications, bridges, utilities, and more in the Canton Network will benefit from proactive threat mitigation. Incentivizing Hexagate to fully integrate and become an expert in Canton Coin opens up the opportunity for all apps and assets in the Network to contract for their services.

## Proposed Changes

- Hexagate will take over operations of their own SV no later than 6 months after the approval of this CIP unless the SV pool prevents expansion to accommodate a new operator in that time frame.
