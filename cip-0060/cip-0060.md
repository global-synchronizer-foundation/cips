## Milestone Mechanics: 
* The GSF Tokenomics committee commits to deliberate each proposed participant and clearly notify Zero Hash if the participant would count against the Adoption Incentives 
* Zero Hash will meet with the GSF Tokenomics committee once every 60 days and provide a progress report towards stated deliverables

## SV Mechanics: 
* An ‘representative’ SV will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in this CIP
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the representative SV
    * The representative SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All representative SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator
    * ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow Applicant to takeover a portion of their SV Weight on a go-forward basis
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight on the representative SV will be removed from the SV Operator configs
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight
