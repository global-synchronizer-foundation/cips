## SV Reward Mechanics: 
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight. 
    * The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the GSF SV node.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.

## **Appendix I -  Motivation**

The Canton Network's value and adoption are directly linked to the ability to use, delegate, pledge, transfer (Canton Coin and tokens on the Canton token standard) at scale.

As institutional adoption grows, there is an increasing need for Canton’s participants to have regulated custody and prime services that can bridge traditional finance, decentralized ledgers, and real-world use cases.

 This integration requires:

1. **Institutional-Grade, Regulated Custody** Financial institutions require compliant, secure and regulated custody services to be able to transact and settle at scale on the Canton Network. By integrating Zodia’s custodial, settlement and collateral services, Canton participants gain access to bank-grade services on-chain.
2. **Multi-asset, multi-chain Portfolio Management**: 
As financial systems become more interconnected, the need to access, transact and manage portfolios at scale between Canton-issued tokens and other chains becomes critical. Zodia’s integration enables users of Canton to seamlessly manage their digital asset portfolio, allowing Canton to become a hub for financial activity market data.
3. **Monetization Opportunities**: 
Participants in the Canton Network can benefit from waived custody fees and even new revenue streams by making their assets available
4. **Connectivity and other Use cases**: 
Many financial applications require wallets connectivity. Zodia will bring both institutional wallets and connectivity to exchanges on our Interchange, Off-Exchange Settlement, product. This will enable additional access to participants across the digital asset ecosystem on Canton.
5. **Scaling Opportunity & Credibility** Integration with a regulated custodian enables credibility, resilience and utility of the multiple use cases involved on the Canton Network among traditional financial institutions. This is particularly useful for settlement and collateral management purposes.

This proposal creates a mutually beneficial relationship where Zodia’s regulated custody services enhance the Canton Network's capabilities and connectivity, while Canton provides Zodia with a privacy-enhancing, secure environment to incorporate as part of its effort to provide financial market infrastructure for digital assets.

## **Appendix II – Why Zodia**

Zodia brings unique advantages to the Canton Network that make it a strong SV candidate:



1. **Global Custodian with Regulatory Credentials**: 
The Zodia Group has physical presence and operates in the UK, EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, UAE (ADGM & VARA), Japan and serves clients globally. It is also registered with the FCA (UK), CBI (EU), CSSF (EU), FSRA (ADGM) and is permitted to operate in Australia and Singapore, whilst licensing is in progress with ASIC and MAS respectively.

2. **Operational Excellence**:

    Major financial institutions trust our bank-grade custody technology and our key operational benefits: 

    a. 	Regulated global custodian, with >$300M insurance

    b. 	24/7 support

    c. 	Security first-approach, with cryptographically signed instructions and a historic audit trail dating back to 2020

    d. 	FATF Travel Rule Compliant

    e. 	SOC I and SOC II certified infrastructure 

3. **Institutional Relationships**: 
Zodia’s client base includes top-tier financial institutions, exchanges, and market makers who represent potential Canton Network participants: 

    a. Global banks and investment firms 

    b. Asset managers and hedge funds 

    c. Cryptocurrency exchanges and market makers 

    d. Index providers and ETF issuers

4. **Complementary Capabilities and Use Cases**: 
Zodia’s focus on wallet connectivity and independent tri-party servicing complements the existing strengths of current Super Validators, adding a specialized capability that enhances the overall network value proposition and allows scalability of existing POCs and applications.

By approving Zodia as a Super Validator, the Canton Network gains not just a node operator but a strategic partner with the practical and operational know-how, market position, and vision to drive new use cases within the network and to enable secure institutional scaling.

## **Appendix III — Zodia’s Scope of Work**

Zodia commits to implementing the services for the Canton Network ecosystem:


**Phase 1: Canton Chain Integration (Month 1)**

* Integrate support for Canton Coin and Canton token standard within Zodia Custody Infrastructure
* Go-live with Canton Wallet management and reporting for clients
* Include Canton in Zodia Rewards Program, a discretionary rewards program that provides waived custody fees and rewards sharing to Zodia’s clients. This incentivizes clients to support more Canton-related activity

**Phase 2: Data Applications – Custody (Month 1-3)**

* Enable seamless inter-custodian settlement on Canton with at least one custodian. This includes settling transactions between the clients of one custodian and the clients of another custodian
* Drive the abstraction of complexity related to a client’s management of the Wallet App, Validator Application and Client Custodial wallets. Enable a singular portfolio management point.

**Phase 3:  Data Applications -  Ancillary Use Cases  (Month 1-6)**

* Support integration of centralized exchanges within Canton Network
* Integrate Zodia Interchange, the Off-Venue Settlement Solution with Canton Network. Execute first settlement between participants via Canton. This enables a strong infrastructure that reduces the need for bilateral interactions between participants and introduces the ability to net settle for trades between participants.
* Integrate Zodia’s Tri party Collateral Management capabilities within Canton, complementing existing bilateral collateral management applications  

Throughout this scope of work, Zodia will maintain regular communication with the Canton Foundation Tokenomics committee, provide detailed progress reports, and ensure all deliverables meet the specified acceptance criteria.
