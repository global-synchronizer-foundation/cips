## Abstract

* Add Layer Zero, Wormhole, and Chainlink as SVs at Weight 3 each
* Create a bonus pool of Weight 5

## Motivation

Building cross-chain bridges is difficult to do well. There are large investments in engineering, testing, and security audits to get it right. Accordingly, each bridge operator should be fairly compensated for their investment to connect to Canton. 

In addition, it is common for one bridge to be considered the ‘preferred’ option of the chain. This can sometimes be expressed by giving that bridge the right to use the common name form of the bridged asset. For example, the ‘preferred’ version of bridged ETH on Canton could be referenced as ETH as opposed to ETH.link (Chainlink bridged ETH). In Canton, we have the option to grant the ETH Canton Naming Service registration to one of the bridges and that would create a similar outcome. 

In this CIP, all three bridge options are being offered equivalent deals for supporting Canton. This CIP also introduces incentives for the bridge that deploys to production first and the one that hits scale first. 

## About Applicants in their own words: 

### Chainlink
* Chainlink is the global standard for connecting blockchains to real-world data, other blockchains, governments, and enterprise systems. Chainlink powers critical use cases across DeFi, banking, tokenized real world assets (RWAs), cross-chain, and more, and is widely adopted by major financial institutions, national governments, and top DeFi protocols, including Swift, DTCC, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Euroclear, Central Bank of Brazil, Fidelity International, UBS, Aave, GMX, Lido, and many more. 
* In the Web3 space The Chainlink platform has operated in production for over half a decade and has secured over $75B+ in DeFi TVL at its peak and has enabled over $20 trillion in transaction value enabled as of March 2025. With 300+ engineers and dedicated monitoring teams, Chainlink Labs is uniquely positioned to offer the depth of support and execution strength needed to operate secure cross-chain and data systems at scale. 
* In the Web3 space, Chainlink secures 92% of total value secured by general purpose oracles, enables 71% of the total DeFi Transaction Value secured by general purpose oracles and powers 55% of DeFi protocols secured by general purpose oracles. Chainlink also powers the biggest DeFi projects, including Aave, Spark, Compound, Venus, dYdX, GMX, etc, and has been integrated with more than 50 public/permissioned blockchain networks. 
* Leading DeFi applications and regulated financial institutions alike are already using Chainlink’s offerings in key deployments, making it a widely used platform in DeFi and capital markets today.

## SV Reward Mechanics: 
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight. This will not include the potential "First to Production" or "Second to Production" bonus weights. 
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.
