## Specification

### Deliverables for Full SV Reward

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Hex Trust integration of Canton Coin and Canton Token Standard** | Hex Trust customers can safekeep CC and any asset on the Canton Network that adheres to the Canton Token Standard | +180 days from CIP Approval | 1 |

### SV Reward Mechanics

- An extraBeneficiary PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight.

- The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.
- The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
- The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
- All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
- ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator

- Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group

- Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List

- The GSF will update the extraBeneficiary to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.
- ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
- If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
  - Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF
  - Remaining SV Weight assigned to the extraBeneficiary SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
  - The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards

- Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements

- If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.

Applicant is subject to **CIP-0045: SV Operating Requirements**.  
If the applicant’s SV Weight > 2.5, they must operate their SV within six months. This SV node will join the network with weight zero and may add weights as milestones are completed.

### Appendix I — Motivation

The Canton Network’s long-term success depends on its ability to bridge institutional finance with decentralized infrastructure in a secure, compliant, and scalable manner. As adoption accelerates, institutional participants require partners that can provide regulated financial services and integrated digital asset infrastructure across jurisdictions.

Hex Trust — as a regulated financial institution across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe — brings this capability to Canton through its established licensing framework and robust infrastructure spanning custody, brokerage, asset management, and payments.

Hex Trust’s mission aligns with Canton’s core principles: to create an institutional-grade and interoperable financial network that can power real-world use cases and regulated asset activity at scale.

**Global Regulatory Posture and Institutional Coverage**

Hex Trust operates under a multi-jurisdictional regulatory framework, including licenses and authorizations across key financial hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, and Europe. Through these entities, Hex Trust provides:

* Regulated Custody Services for digital and tokenized assets under financial authority supervision  
* Staking  
* Escrow  
* Wrapping services  
* Broker-Dealer and Asset Management Services, enabling compliant market participation and tokenized investment products  
* Major Payment Institution capabilities, bridging fiat and digital economies through regulated on/off-ramps and settlement rails  

This regulatory breadth ensures that Canton participants benefit from a globally recognized and compliant framework, unlocking institutional confidence and cross-border utility.
