# CIP 0032

## Summary

- **Add Lukka as a Tier3 SV (Weight 1)**
  - Lukka commits to provide on-chain AML monitoring of Canton Coin transactions by no later than 6 months after the approval of this CIP.
- Lukka is already a General Member of the GSF.

## Motivation

- On-chain AML monitoring is critical for supporting parties in the Canton Network that wish to send/receive Canton Coin as a regular part of their business.
  - On-chain AML monitoring helps senders de-risk outbound transactions by having a better understanding about the legitimacy of the destination address.
  - Inbound Canton Coin transfers come with information regarding the safety of the incoming Coins from an AML perspective.
- Absent this capability, institutional participants will be limited and hesitant to use Canton Coin as part of their ordinary business activities.
