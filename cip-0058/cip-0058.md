## Abstract:

* Add IntellectEU as a Tier3 SV (Weight 1)
* IntellectEU commits to add a Contributor to Splice.
* IntellectEU will meaningfully contribute to the Splice repos at least once per month for at least 1 year, focusing on resolving issues, but without an obligation to complete all listed tasks/issues
* As the operator of the GSF multi-tenant SV, IntellectEU will implement the necessary infrastructure in order to operationalize the milestone-based CIP rewards structure as described in the “Mechanics” section within this CIP.


## About Applicant:
IntellectEU empowers businesses worldwide with the tools and expertise required to navigate digital finance innovation and payment modernization. As a service and infrastructure provider for the Canton Network, IntellectEU’s flagship solution, Catalyst Blockchain Manager, empowers financial enterprises to build, manage, and scale their digital asset offerings and is used by participants on the Canton Network to support their operations.  IntellectEU currently operates the GSF multi-tenant SV and is a node operator, supporting multiple Validator nodes from both an infrastructure and development standpoint in order to bring their applications onto the Network.

**Deliverables for full SV Reward:**

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| Enable escrow mechanisms to ensure Super Validators deliver value in return for rewards | As the maintainer of the GSF multi-tenant SV, IntellectEU will implement the necessary infrastructure in order to operationalize the milestone-based CIP rewards structure as described in the “Mechanics” section within this CIP. | +60 days | 0.5 |
| Commit at least one resource to maintain and resolve issues within the Splice repo | IntellectEU will document the resolved issues/contributions to the Splice repo, demonstrating at least one contribution per month. | +90 days | 0.5 |

## Mechanics:

IntellectEU will implement the following mechanics both for itself, and for all other Super Validators whose SV weights are contigent on completion of specified contributions, following similar mechanics: 
    * ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in the CIP that granted rights to that Super Validator.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight
