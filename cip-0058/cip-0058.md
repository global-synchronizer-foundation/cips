## Abstract

* Add IntellectEU as a Tier3 SV (Weight 1)
* IntellectEU will offer a Package Manager to the network to foster seamless application updates across all the participants
* IntellectEU will integrate and connect custodian/key management systems within their Catalyst Blockchain Manager to be used by Canton Network participants and commits to integrate with at least 1 this year.
* As the operator of the GSF multi-tenant SV, we will implement the necessary infrastructure in order to operationalize the milestone-based CIP rewards structure

#### Specification
* Catalyst Package Manager is a smart contract-based registry for discovering, versioning, and distributing Canton-based applications. It supports metadata like name, version, publisher, and dependencies. Participants and validators can subscribe to apps and receive updates automatically. A CLI will be provided for publishing and retrieval
* IntellectEU will update the GSF multi-tenant SV to support a milestone-based escrow system for SV rewards. CIP rewards will be locked and released upon verified milestone completion, with criteria and status transparently published for community visibility.
*IntellectEUâ€™s Catalyst Blockchain Manager will support integration with external custody and key management systems (e.g., AWS KMS, Dfns) for secure transaction signing. Features will include key rotation, audit logging, and access control

## Motivation

As the Canton Network scales, there is a growing need for tools that simplify collaboration, enhance security, and ensure accountability among participants. This proposal addresses three key areas to support that growth:
1. Seamless application sharing and discovery across the network.

2. Enterprise-grade key management and custody integration to meet the needs of institutional users running a validator node.

3. Milestone-based reward structures to ensure SVs contribute tangible value.

Together, these initiatives are designed to improve developer and end-user experience, increase network trust, and encourage more robust and compliant application deployment on Canton

## Rationale
* **Canton Package Manager (Weight 0.5):** A key scalability challenge on the Canton Network is enabling the seamless sharing of business applications among network participants. The Catalyst Package Manager (CPM) addresses this by serving as an application registry and collaboration gateway. It allows developers to easily publish updates while giving validators a streamlined interface to discover and connect to applications, thereby accelerating network activity.
* **Catalyst KMS and Custody Support (Weight 0.25):** Supporting KMS and custody solutions with Catalyst is essential to meet the security and compliance requirements of institutional users. This reduces operational risk by simplifying key management and improving the developer experience. Validators can securely sign transactions using trusted infrastructure, avoiding custom implementations. This also unlocks high-value use cases like tokenization and payments where secure custody is a must.
* **GSF Escrow Mechanism (Weight 0.25):** As additional SVs join the network, it is important to ensure they deliver on their value contributions in order to receive SV rewards. To support this, the existing GSF multi-tenant node hosted by IEU will need to be updated to include an escrow mechanism that releases SV rewards upon the completion of defined milestones.
