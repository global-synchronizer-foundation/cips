## Abstract

This CIP proposes adding IntellectEU as a Tier 3 Super Validator (SV) to the Canton Network. As part of their role, IntellectEU will deliver infrastructure to support milestone-based rewards, an onchain package manager, and secure custody integrations.

#### Specification
* Deploy a smart contract-based Catalyst Package Manager to manage discovery, versioning, and distribution of Canton applications.
* Implement an onchain escrow mechanism in the GSF multi-tenant SV to hold and release CIP rewards upon milestone completion.
* Register IntellectEU as a Tier 3 SV with provisional weight 1, subject to milestone-based reward minting. Minting rights must be formally requested and approved by the Tokenomics Group upon verification of milestone completion.

## Motivation

The CIP addresses the following challenges in the growing Canton ecosystem:

* Lack of a shared registry for application discovery and updates across participants.
* Inadequate support for enterprise-grade key management and secure transaction signing.
* Absence of accountability mechanisms to ensure Super Validators deliver value in return for rewards.

## Rationale
IntellectEU will make the following solutions available via the Global Synchronizer: 
* **Canton Package Manager (Weight 0.5):** A decentralized registry enables network-wide collaboration and efficient deployment. Catalyst’s existing capabilities reduce time-to-delivery and offer a familiar interface to developers, accelerating adoption.
* **Catalyst KMS and Custody Support (Weight 0.25):** IntellectEU’s Catalyst Blockchain Manager will support integration with external custody and key management systems (e.g., MPCH, Dfns, AWS KMS, etc.) for secure transaction signing. Features will include key rotation, audit logging, and access control.
* **GSF Escrow Mechanism (Weight 0.25):** A milestone-based system increases transparency and ensures SVs are rewarded based on verified contributions. IntellectEU commits to upgrading the GSF-hosted SV node to enable this logic.
