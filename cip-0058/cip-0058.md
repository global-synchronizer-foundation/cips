## Abstract

This CIP proposes adding IntellectEU as a Tier 3 Super Validator (SV) to the Canton Network. As part of their role, IntellectEU will deliver infrastructure to support milestone-based rewards, an onchain package manager, and secure custody integrations.

#### Specification
* Deploy a smart contract-based Catalyst Package Manager to manage discovery, versioning, and distribution of Canton applications.
* Implement an onchain escrow mechanism in the GSF multi-tenant SV to hold and release CIP rewards upon milestone completion.
* Extend the GSF-hosted SV infrastructure to support secure transaction signing through integration with external custody and key management systems (e.g., AWS KMS, Dfns), including support for key rotation, audit logging, and role-based access control. IntellectEU commits to integrating with at least one such provider within the current year.
* Register IntellectEU as a Tier 3 SV with weight 1.

## Motivation

The CIP addresses the following challenges in the growing Canton ecosystem:

* Lack of a shared registry for application discovery and updates across participants.
* Inadequate support for enterprise-grade key management and secure transaction signing.
* Absence of accountability mechanisms to ensure Super Validators deliver value in return for rewards.

## Rationale
* **Canton Package Manager:** A decentralized registry enables network-wide collaboration and efficient deployment. Catalyst’s existing capabilities reduce time-to-delivery and offer a familiar interface to developers, accelerating adoption.
* **Custody Integration:** Catalyst Blockchain Manager already integrates with secure signing infrastructure, which reduces validator onboarding complexity and aligns with institutional requirements.
* **Escrow-Based Rewards:** A milestone-based system increases transparency and ensures SVs are rewarded based on verified contributions. IntellectEU commits to upgrading the GSF-hosted SV node to enable this logic.
