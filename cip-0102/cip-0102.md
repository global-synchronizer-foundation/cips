## Abstract

Add Tharimmune, Inc. (“Tharimmune”) as a weight 10 Super Validator (SV) on the Global Synchronizer.  Reward weight will be granted via escrow mechanism and released in tranches as milestones are delivered. Tharimmune is a Canton ecosystem–focused digital asset treasury company that has publicly committed capital and participation to the network, including validator operations and ecosystem support.  Tharimmune will act as a new, independent operator to strengthen decentralization and provide public‑goods contributions to the network.

## Motivation

Tharimmune recently announced a >$500M private placement to establish a Canton Coin (CC) treasury and actively participate in the network via validator infrastructure and application development. Onboarding Tharimmune as an SV allows Tharimmune to strengthen its commitment to the ecosystem by driving utility, enhancing governance participation, providing public goods and assisting with community engagement across the Canton ecosystem. Tharimmune’s stated strategy includes running validators and contributing tools and standards—activities aligned with SV responsibilities.

Tharimmune’s planned membership and committee participation further anchors accountability for the milestones in this CIP.

## About the Applicant

Admit Tharimmune as a Super Validator with total requested reward weight 10, granted into escrow and released in milestone‑based tranches as defined below.

## Deliverables for Full SV Reward

The proposed framework allocates a total potential weight of 10 across two key areas: Governance Participation (0.5), Public Goods Delivery (5.5), and Ecosystem Community Engagement (4).
| Description | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |

| Tharimmune to deliver open analytics dashboard based on Foundation requests | Tharimmune will deliver and support an analytics dashboard for public consumption to assist community members with network analysis and governance decisions. Requirements will be agreed with the Canton Foundation.<br><br>This dashboard will be used as the distribution mechanism for additional analytics studies.<br><br>An initial indicative draft of features is included in Appendix I.<br><br>Acceptance Criteria (delivery):<br>• Tharimmune deploys dashboard, available to the public over the internet<br>• Delivery to be reviewed by Accountability Committee and agreed Foundation stakeholders. Both to confirm all in-scope features are included<br><br>Acceptance Criteria (support):<br>• Tharimmune will maintain and support delivered features the dashboard for 2 years after CIP approval<br>• Weight will be unlocked 2 years from CIP approval, if:<br>• Dashboard is delivered within milestone timeline; and<br>• Accountability committee provides approval of support each quarter for the 2-year timeline | 6 months from CIP approval for delivery<br><br>2 years from CIP approval for support | +2.5<br>(+2 weight delivery)<br>(+0.5 weight support) |
| Provide additional analytics studies | Tharimmune will commit to adding four new analytics studies to the public analytics dashboard at the reasonable request of the Foundation. Each additional study will be mutually agreed upon, in good faith, by Tharimmune and the Foundation. Each additional study will be scoped, with acceptance criteria, by the Foundation and subsequently developed and delivered by Tharimmune.<br><br>Each study shall have a separate, non-overlapping 30-day completion period. If the time remaining before the milestone deadline is insufficient to accommodate these periods for any newly requested studies, the milestone deadline shall be extended to the last day of the final required 30-day period. If at the milestone deadline, the Foundation has not requested all 4 studies, Tharimmune will not earn the weight or unminted CC associated with any unrequested study. The associated untimed CC will remain in the unminted pool.<br><br>For each delivered public good:<br>• Delivery acceptance criteria will be agreed upon between Tharimmune and the Tokenomics Committee | 18 months from CIP approval | +1 Max<br>(+0.25 per delivery) |

## SV Reward Mechanics

- An extraBeneficiary PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight.  
- The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.  
- The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV.  
- The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block-by-block basis.  
- All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool.  
- ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator.  
- Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group.  
- Applicant must present a calculation for the number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting milestone requirements.  
- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and approves the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.  
- The GSF will update the extraBeneficiary to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.  
- ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the approved calculation.  

### Failure to Meet Milestones

If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:

- Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF.  
- Remaining SV Weight assigned to the extraBeneficiary SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.  
- The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards.

## Operational Expectations (non-exhaustive)

- **SV operations:** Maintain reliable SV infrastructure in line with official guidance (Kubernetes deployment, DR, security hardening, monitoring).  
- **Governance:** Participate in SV votes and network governance; publish milestone progress and artifacts (CIPs, repos, docs).  
- **Security:** Follow KMS recommendations for participant keys and adopt SV security-hardening practices.  
- **Transparency:** Provide quarterly milestone updates to the Accountability committee (and Tokenomics where applicable).
