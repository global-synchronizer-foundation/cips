## Abstract

Add Tharimmune, Inc. (“Tharimmune”) as a weight 4 Super Validator (SV) on the Global Synchronizer. Reward weight will be granted via escrow mechanism and released in tranches as milestones are delivered. Tharimmune is a Canton ecosystem–focused digital asset treasury company that has publicly committed capital and participation to the network, including validator operations and ecosystem support. Tharimmune will act as a new, independent operator to strengthen decentralization and provide public-goods contributions to the network.

## Motivation

Tharimmune recently announced a $545M private placement to establish a Canton Coin (CC) treasury and actively participate in the network via validator infrastructure and application development. Onboarding Tharimmune as an SV allows Tharimmune to strengthen its commitment to the ecosystem by driving utility, enhancing governance participation, providing public goods and assisting with community engagement across the Canton ecosystem. Tharimmune’s stated strategy includes running validators and contributing standards and tools—activities aligned with SV responsibilities. Tharimmune operates as a publicly listed company and adheres to SEC and Nasdaq rules.

Tharimmune’s planned membership and committee participation further anchors accountability for the milestones in this CIP.

## About the Applicant

Admit Tharimmune as a Super Validator with total requested reward weight 4, granted into escrow and released in milestone-based tranches as defined below.

## Deliverables for Full SV Reward

The proposed framework allocates a total potential weight of 4 in Ecosystem Community Engagement.

### Deliverable 1: Publish Quarterly Ecosystem Research Report

**Description**  
Publish a quarterly report covering: on-chain analytics, community developments, governance/tokenomics, planned tech updates, and dashboard statistics. Report will be filed with Nasdaq and distributed as a PR report under the ticker. As a publicly traded company our reach is much broader across institutional and retail investors. Weight earned quarterly until the CIP max weight is earned, then continue quarterly for an additional 1 year.

**Deadline**  
2.25 years from CIP approval

**Weight Earned**  
+2 Max  
(+0.25 per quarterly report)

### Deliverable 2: Hold Public Quarterly Community Webinar

**Description**  
Hold an open-to-the-public quarterly webinar (min 45 min) covering: on-chain analytics, community developments, governance/tokenomics, and planned tech updates. As a publicly traded company our reach is much broader across institutional and retail investors. Weight earned per webinar for 2 years following CIP approval.

**Deadline**  
2.25 years from CIP approval

**Weight Earned**  
+2 Max  
(+0.25 per quarterly webinar)

## SV Reward Mechanics

- An extraBeneficiary PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight.  
- The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.  
- The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV.  
- The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block-by-block basis.  
- All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool.  
- ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator.  
- Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group.  
- Applicant must present a calculation for the number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting milestone requirements.  
- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and approves the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.  
- The GSF will update the extraBeneficiary to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.  
- ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the approved calculation.  

### Failure to Meet Milestones

If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:

- Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF.  
- Remaining SV Weight assigned to the extraBeneficiary SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.  
- The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards.

## Operational Expectations (non-exhaustive)

- **SV operations:** Maintain reliable SV infrastructure in line with official guidance (Kubernetes deployment, DR, security hardening, monitoring).  
- **Governance:** Participate in SV votes and network governance; publish milestone progress and artifacts (CIPs, repos, docs).  
- **Security:** Follow KMS recommendations for participant keys and adopt SV security-hardening practices.  
- **Transparency:** Provide quarterly milestone updates to the Accountability committee (and Tokenomics where applicable).
