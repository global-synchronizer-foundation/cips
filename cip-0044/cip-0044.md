## Motivation

*  On-chain AML monitoring is critical for supporting parties in the Canton Network that wish to send/receive Canton Coin as a regular part of their business 
  * On-chain AML monitoring helps senders de-risk outbound transactions by having a better understanding about the legitimacy of the destination address 
  *  Inbound Canton Coin transfers come with information regarding the safety of the incoming Coins from an AML perspective 
* Absent this capability, institutional participants will be limited and hesitant to use Canton Coin as part of their ordinary business activities 
* Elliptic is one of the requested AML providers by Circle
