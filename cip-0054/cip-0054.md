## Abstract

* Add Figment as a Weight 1 Super Validator
* Figment commits to support Canton in their Validator as a Service product offering no later than 6 months after the approval of this CIP

#### Specification
* Increase the GSF’s minting weight +1 and assign to Figment


## Motivation

* Accessing the Canton Network currently requires running one (or many) Validators
* Few entities are skilled enough and/or desire to run their own Validators
* The uptime of a Validator is critical in Canton as your Validator is part of the validation consensus protocol and is best served by a professional organization with a strong history of uptime
* The Canton Network is upgrading regularly and node operators benefit from investing in automation and the productization of the node ops - most do not have the time, desire, or capabilities to do this themselves
* Figment has an impressive customer base which includes many of the Canton Network's supporters. Figment can help to expand the Network's user footprint by facilitating node distribution and educating their customers about Canton


## Rationale
* Figment is the leading provider of staking infrastructure, offering comprehensive staking solutions for over 700 institutional clients—including asset managers, exchanges, wallets, foundations, custodians, and large token holders.
* Figment's institutional staking services include seamless point-and-click staking, portfolio reward tracking, API integrations, audited infrastructure, and slashing protection.
* As of March 2025, Figment has staked over $15 billion in assets across various blockchain networks, and on Ethereum, Figment is the largest non-custodial staking provider of staked ETH.
