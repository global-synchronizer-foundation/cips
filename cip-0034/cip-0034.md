# CIP 0034

## Summary

- Add Proof Group as a Tier3 SV (Weight 1)
- Proof Group commits to build and deploy a publicly available block explorer for Canton Coin in no less than 6 months from CIP approval.
- Proof Group commits to maintain and improve the block explorer for Canton Coin for 2 years.
- Proof Group commits to be a Maintainer on the Splice Repo and contribute code to that repo to support their block explorer.

## Motivation

- Digital Asset and the Super Validators have provided a bare-bones Ledger Scan experience, but it has several shortcomings:
  - The data presented is very low level.
  - It seeks to serve only basic interrogation needs of the ledger.
- A 3rd party provided block explorer presents the opportunity to have a much improved user experience, focused on providing higher-level insights and utility.

## About Proof Group

- We are a team of former crypto founders and venture investors, backing the next generation of founders building disruptive financial technology.

## Proposed Changes

- Increase the GSFâ€™s minting weight +1 and assign to Proof Group.
- Proof Group will take over operations of their own SV no later than 6 months after the approval of this CIP unless the SV pool prevents expansion to accommodate a new operator in that time frame.
