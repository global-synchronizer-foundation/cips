## Summary
This CIP proposes that the Tokenomics Committee has the right to recommend adjustments to the ledger cost parameter ($/MB) to the Super Validators (SVs) without requiring a new CIP each time. This will enable proactive management of accelerated scaling demand while longer-term scaling investments are deployed.

## Motivation
The Canton Network is experiencing incredible demand and has rapidly accelerating momentum across institutional and retail adoption.

* **Institutional Onboarding:** A significant waiting list exists for new validators.  
* **Retail Readiness:** Retail motions are beginning to onboard users by the tens of thousands with continued pent-up demand.  
* **Asset Growth:** Multiple new assets are expected to come online in quick succession.  

All of this is leading to rapidly accelerating expansion and adoption of the network.

Long-term scaling investments are in progress. However, in the short term, the network requires some adjustment to align incentives and maintain orderly scaling.

## Proposed Changes
Until a new CIP revokes this process:

* The Tokenomics Committee will periodically review on-chain and off-chain scaling data.  
* Based on its assessment, the Committee will make recommendations to Super Validators regarding the appropriate cost per MB ($/MB) to use the ledger.  
* Super Validators should implement these recommendations, ensuring alignment with network stability and scaling objectives.

### Purpose of Adjustments
1. Manage increasing demand in a controlled and orderly manner.  
2. Maintain the highest level of network stability as activity ramps up.  
3. Provide sufficient time for scaling investments to be realized and adopted.
