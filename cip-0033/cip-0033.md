# CIP 0033

## Summary

- Add Strange Pixels as a Tier4 SV (Weight 0.5)
- Strange Pixels commits to offering to operate Super Validators for other Super Validators.

## Motivation

- Orb-1 has decided to change their SV Operator from Strange Pixels to MPCH and, as such, we risk losing an experienced operator.
- Strange Pixels is an existing, trained operator in the Global Synchronizer.
- Adding Strange Pixels requires no additional overhead for other Super Validators.
- Increasing the SV Operator pool improves the decentralization of the Global Synchronizer:
  - Increases resiliency of the Global Synchronizer.
  - Decreases coordination overhead of any single SV being down.
