## Abstract

- Allow existing Validator operators to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants.
- Redirect new individual Validator applicants to approved existing operators.
- Maintain a controlled, trusted, and orderly network expansion.

## Specification

- Existing Validator operators will be authorized to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants.
- Third-party applicants wishing to run a Validator will be redirected to an existing operator.
- Pre-approved operators, such as Kiln, will retain their prior allocations (e.g., 30 Validators).
- Operators such as IEU, MPCH, Proof Group, and others already running their own Validators will be given discretion in onboarding third-party Validators.
- This policy ensures a structured and scalable approach to Validator expansion while maintaining network integrity and supportability.

## Motivation

As interest in the network grows, there is increasing demand from individuals wanting to become Validators. However, onboarding independent Validators without oversight could introduce operational and security risks. This proposal establishes a controlled mechanism for growth, leveraging existing trusted operators to facilitate expansion while maintaining an orderly network.

## Rationale

The current approach ensures:
- Network stability by limiting Validator growth to approved operators.
- A direct point of contact for any network-related issues.
- A structured expansion process that aligns with the networkâ€™s steady rollout.
- Efficient use of existing operators' expertise and infrastructure.

Alternative approaches, such as an open application process, were considered but deemed too difficult to manage at this stage. This proposal strikes a balance between controlled growth and decentralization.


## Backwards compatibility

This proposal does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities. It only modifies the policy for onboarding new Validators.

## Reference implementation

No code changes are required for this proposal. Implementation involves updating policy documentation and communicating guidelines to existing Validator operators.
