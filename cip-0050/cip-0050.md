## Abstract

- Allow existing Validator operators to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants.
- Redirect new individual Validator applicants to approved existing operators.
## Specification

- Existing Validator operators will be authorized to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants.
- Third-party applicants wishing to run a Validator will be redirected to an existing operator.
- Pre-approved operators, such as Kiln, Dfns and Copper, who have already been granted the right to operate up to 30 validator nodes, will retain that right.
- Operators such as IEU, MPCH, Proof Group, and others already running their own Validators will be given discretion in onboarding third-party Validators.
- This policy ensures a structured and scalable approach to Validator expansion while maintaining network integrity and supportability.
- The [application process](https://sync.global/validator-request/) is to become your own operator.

## Motivation

- As interest in the network grows, there is increasing demand from individuals wanting to become Validators. However, onboarding independent Validators without oversight could introduce operational and security risks. This proposal establishes a controlled mechanism for growth, leveraging existing trusted operators to facilitate expansion while maintaining an orderly network.
- Maintain a controlled, trusted, and orderly network expansion.


## Rationale

The current approach ensures:
- Network stability by limiting Validator growth to approved operators.
- A direct point of contact for any network-related issues.
- A structured expansion process that aligns with the networkâ€™s steady rollout.
- Efficient use of existing operators' expertise and infrastructure.

Alternative approaches, such as an open application process, were considered but deemed too difficult to manage at this stage. This proposal strikes a balance between controlled growth and decentralization.


## Backwards compatibility

This proposal does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities. It only modifies the policy for onboarding new Validators.

## Reference implementation

No code changes are required for this proposal. Implementation involves updating policy documentation and communicating guidelines to existing Validator operators.
