### Abstract

* Add AngelHack as a Super Validator with provisional weight 2.5.
* Super Validator rewards will remain unminted until defined milestones are completed and verified by the Tokenomics Group.
* If AngelHack fails to meet its milestones, unearned SV weight will not be eligible for minting and will be forfeited.

#### Specification
* Grant AngelHack the right to operate a Super Validator node and join the network’s next onboarding group.
* Assign AngelHack a provisional SV weight of 2.5, with rewards to remain unminted until milestone completion.
* Require AngelHack to formally request the right to mint rewards upon demonstrating that defined milestones have been met, subject to review and approval by the Tokenomics Group.
* Establish clear milestones and deadlines for each commitment, to be reviewed monthly in coordination with the Tokenomics Group.
* If AngelHack fails to meet defined milestones, the associated unminted rewards and SV weight will be forfeited.

## Motivation

AngelHack proposes to join the Canton Network as a Super Validator Node, leveraging its extensive global network of over 300,000 developers and a proven track record of incubating more than 200 startups and projects.

AngelHack’s contributions will focus on three key areas:
* To **drive active contribution to Canton’s open-sourced repository** with core engineers
* To drive network utility by **building innovative applications** on top of Canton that generate substantial transactional activity
* To nurture and **expand Canton's developer ecosystem** by attracting and mentoring the next generation of blockchain engineers.

## Rationale
![img](/cip-0053/cip-0053.png)

AngelHack is a global innovation platform with a vast developer network and a strong record of startup incubation. Its experience with hackathons, accelerator programs, and education aligns well with the Canton Network’s need for ecosystem growth and technical expansion.

*AngelHack commits to the following deliverables, which will be defined as formal milestones subject to verification by the Tokenomics Group:
    * Staff a dedicated team to contribute to the Canton OSS repositories
    * Incubate applications that drive meaningful transaction volume on Canton
    * Expand the developer ecosystem through targeted hackathons and workshops
    * Facilitate strategic partnerships through its global BD network
    * Participate actively in governance discussions and decision-making
    * Join the GSF as a General Member
    * Submit monthly progress updates to the Tokenomics Group and formally request minting of rewards upon milestone completion

### 1. Technical and Developer Contributions

* **Core Engineering Team (Weight 1):** AngelHack will deploy a dedicated team of experienced blockchain engineers to **actively contribute to Canton’s open sourced repository**. On top of that, our core engineers would also work on **planning and defining the technical roadmap** to facilitate and onboard additional contributors effectively. This dual approach ensures continuous innovation and sustained development activities. 

* **Application Incubator (Weight 0.5):** AngelHack will deploy a dedicated team of experienced blockchain engineers to work on developing applications - both references with robust documentation as well as into production - built on the Canton Network. These applications will be designed to educate the broader developer ecosystem, drive high transaction volumes, and ensure robust network activity and transaction fee generation.

    Considered Applications include
    * DAO / Validator Pools / Decentralized governance
    * Trusted Liveness Services
    * DEX templates
    * Peer to Peer Micro loans
    * Launchpads (kickstarter)
    * Prediction markets
    * RWA Trading

### 2. Strategic Partnerships and Developer Community Growth

* **Developer Community Growth (Weight 0.5):** Leveraging our extensive global network, AngelHack will spearhead initiatives to attract and onboard blockchain developers to the Canton ecosystem. This can be done through targeted hackathons, technical workshops, and mentorship programs. We aim to significantly grow the pool of skilled engineers focused on **deploying applications** and **increasing transactions** on Canton. 

* **Strategic Partnerships (Weight 0.5):** We plan to facilitate partnerships between **established enterprises, financial institutions**, regional and global **system integrators** and promising **blockchain startups**, using our community and network to drive real-world application deployments on Canton, thereby expanding its reach and utility.

### 3. Governance and Long-Term Collaboration

* **Active Governance Participation (Weight 0):** As a Super Validator Node, AngelHack will actively engage in Canton Network governance, participating in the Canton Improvement Proposal (CIP) process and helping shape the future of the network. Our commitment includes aligning with the Global Synchronizer Foundation’s principles and contributing to strategic decisions that support network growth. 

* **Sustainable Network Economics (Weight 0):** By operating as both a Validator and an active application developer, AngelHack will help sustain the network’s economic model, driving both Validator rewards and Featured Application rewards through consistent and innovative transaction generation.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal does not introduce any backward compatibility issues as it solely modifies the governance structure by adjusting Super Validator weights.
