## SV Reward Mechanics

- An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the 'escrowed' Super Validator will be set up by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight.
  - The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.
  - The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV.
  - The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block-by-block basis.
  - All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool.
- ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator.
- Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group.
  - Applicant must present a calculation for the number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting milestone requirements.
- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and approves the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.
  - The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.
  - ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant's Validator, based on the approved calculation.
- If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:
  - Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF.
  - Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
  - The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards.

## Motivation

The Canton Network stands at the forefront of transforming regulated finance through its privacy-enabled blockchain architecture, specifically designed to handle real-world assets (RWAs) with seamless interoperability. However, as it scales to accommodate institutional demands, it encounters challenges that Blockdaemon is uniquely positioned to address. Blockdaemon's motivation stems from a shared vision with Canton: to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with blockchain innovation, creating a secure, compliant ecosystem where regulated entities can tokenize assets, execute atomic cross-chain transactions, and unify liquidity without sacrificing privacy or control. By becoming a Super Validator, Blockdaemon not only expands its footprint in the growing RWA sector but also leverages its institutional-grade expertise to co-build a network that accelerates global financial efficiency, driving mutual growth through increased adoption and network utility.

Blockdaemon is driven by the opportunity to solve Canton's core pain points, which are critical for realizing its ambition as a leading platform for privacy-preserving, regulated finance. These challenges and Blockdaemon's targeted solutions include:

- **Scalability and Node Reliability:** Canton needs robust infrastructure to handle high-volume atomic transactions across interconnected networks, where even minor downtime could disrupt institutional workflows. Blockdaemon solves this by deploying multi-cloud, high-availability validator nodes with 99.99% uptime guarantees, improving the network's decentralization and ensuring uninterrupted synchronization for RWAs like tokenized bonds or securities.

- **Institutional Onboarding and Compliance Barriers:** Attracting banks, asset managers, and custodians requires low-friction entry points compliant with stringent regulations (e.g., AML/KYC, SOC 2 Type II). Canton's privacy focus is an asset, but onboarding hurdles can slow adoption. Blockdaemon tackles this by providing customized toolkits, enterprise wallets, and compliance reports, onboarding at least 10 institutions to increase total value locked (TVL) and transaction volume, while aligning with Canton's goal of regulatory-grade interoperability.

- **Liquidity Unification Across Siloed Systems:** Canton's vision of cross-chain synchronization is hindered by fragmented liquidity and interoperability risks in siloed TradFi systems. Blockdaemon contributes by developing DeFi gateways and cross-chain bridges (compatible with protocols like CCIP), enabling secure RWA tokenization and liquidity pooling, which directly enhances Canton's atomic transaction capabilities and attracts more institutional liquidity.

- **Security and Risk Management in Regulated Environments:** For a network handling sensitive RWAs, ongoing audits and threat mitigation are essential to build trust among regulated entities. Blockdaemon's motivation includes sharing its security expertise through annual audits and AML-compatible tools, fortifying Canton's resilience against vulnerabilities while supporting its privacy-first ethos.

In a broader landscape where privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny often stall blockchain adoption in finance, Blockdaemon's contributions perfectly align with Canton's mission to create a unified, decentralized marketplace for RWAs. This structured approach not only fosters sustained value addition but also incentivizes Blockdaemon's long-term commitment, positioning Canton as the premier platform for regulated, privacy-preserving finance and enabling Blockdaemon to pioneer infrastructure solutions in this emerging sector.

## Rationale

Blockdaemon stands out due to its deep focus on institutional needs, securing billions in assets and supporting major TradFi players in transitioning to blockchain-based solutions. Unlike specialized data providers, Blockdaemon delivers foundational infrastructure that directly aligns with the Canton Network's core mission of enabling privacy-preserving interoperability for regulated real-world assets (RWAs). This justifies a weight of 7.5, as Blockdaemon's offerings enhance Canton's ability to facilitate atomic cross-chain transactions while maintaining data privacy and institutional control—key to attracting banks, asset managers, and custodians wary of public blockchains.

Blockdaemon's track record in compliance (e.g., SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications) and scalability ensures seamless integration with Canton's Daml-based smart contracts and Global Synchronizer, reducing operational risks in high-stakes environments. By providing secure node hosting, and AML/KYC-compatible wallets, Blockdaemon accelerates Canton's adoption in tokenized assets, such as fixed-income securities or RWAs, where regulatory alignment is paramount. Furthermore, Blockdaemon's expertise in multi-cloud deployments and API-driven tools supports Canton's goal of unifying liquidity across siloed financial systems, enabling faster, more secure synchronization without compromising privacy.

In addition, Blockdaemon's proven ability to onboard enterprises through partnerships (e.g., with global financial institutions) will drive network growth, leveraging referral-based incentives (per existing CIPs like 0007) to bring more validators and apps. This unique value proposition—combining enterprise-grade reliability with tools tailored for regulated finance—positions Blockdaemon as an essential partner in realizing Canton's vision of a decentralized, privacy-enabled ecosystem for institutional-grade asset tokenization and interoperability.
