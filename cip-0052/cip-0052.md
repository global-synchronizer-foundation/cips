## Abstract

* Monstera FZE (“**Monstera**”) as a SV at Weight [3]
* Monstera commits to bring at least 5 major users of Canton to the Network in the next 6 months
* If Monstera overperforms and provides > 5 major users, it will earn 0.75 incremental SV weight (at the time the participant goes live on MainNet) for each approved participant above the 5 up to a total SV Weight of 5.25 possible 


#### Specification
* Increase the GSF’s minting weight +3 and assign to a segregated account controlled by the GSF
* GSF will distribute funds from extra weight to Monstera as commitments are met
