## Abstract

* Add Monstera FZE (“Monstera”) as a Super Validator with provisional weight 3.
* Monstera commits to bring at least five major users to the Canton Network within six months.
* For each additional qualified user beyond the first five (approved by the Tokenomics Group), Monstera may request to mint an additional 0.75 SV weight, up to a total possible weight of 5.25.
* SV rewards will remain unminted until milestones are completed and approved by the Tokenomics Group.

#### Specification
* Grant Monstera the right to operate a Super Validator node and join the next onboarding group.
* Assign Monstera a provisional SV weight of 3, with all rewards to remain unminted until milestone completion.
* For each new major user successfully onboarded and approved by the Tokenomics Group, Monstera may request to mint:
   * 20% of the SV rewards associated with this CIP
   * 0.6 SV weight (with up to 0.75 SV weight possible per additional user beyond the baseline five)
* Total SV weight for Monstera may reach up to 5.25, pending performance and approval.
* The Tokenomics Group will evaluate and approve each user candidate in advance to determine whether they qualify toward the milestone targets.
* If Monstera fails to meet the minimum target of five approved users by the defined deadline, unminted SV weight and rewards will be forfeited and remain with the GSF.

## Motivation

* Similar to the 5North Ecosystem Fund, this proposal aims to expand Canton Network adoption by partnering with industry leaders that can activate high-value use cases, particularly in the collateralized asset and stablecoin space. Monstera brings a unique regional and sectoral network that can support institutional onboarding at scale.

## Rationale
* Monstera commits to use its capital, influence, and operational capacity to bring strategic participants to the Canton Network. Its core commitments include:
    * Delivering at least five new major users within six months
    * Integrating these participants with assets issued on the Global Synchronizer (e.g., USDC, USYC)
    * Ensuring each participant is live on MainNet before associated rewards are minted
* Example potential participants include (connection in parentheses):
    * APAC:
        * Tokyo Dome / Mitsui Fudosan (Chairman)
        * Sun Hung Kai & Co (CEO & Majority Shareholder)
        * Air Asia (Founder & CEO)
    * Middle East:
        * Mashreq Bank (CEO)
        * Dubai Stock Exchange (CEO)
        * Abu Dhabi First Bank (Board Member)
    * Europe: 
        * Deutsche Bank (Board Member)
        * Munich Re (Board Member)
    * LATAM: 
        * Salinas Group (Founder, Chairman)
* The GSF Tokenomics committee will review each proposed participant and notify Monstera in advance whether the participant qualifies toward the commitment quota.
* Coins earned on the GSF SV will be held by the Foundation in a segregated account and only released to Monstera upon successful onboarding of each participant.
    * 20% of escrowed holdings will be released per approved participant joining the Network.
    * 20% of SV weight will be assigned to Monstera Validator per approved participant joining the Network.
* If Monstera fails to meet the KPI targets by the final deadline, all unearned SV weight will be forfeited and returned to the GSF.
* Monstera will meet with the GSF Tokenomics committee once every month to provide a progress report on stated commitments.
