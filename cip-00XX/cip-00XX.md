## Appendix I
<a id="appendix-i"></a>

### Benefits of LayerZero Protocol
<a id="benefits-of-layerzero-protocol"></a>

#### Application-Owned Security Model
<a id="application-owned-security-model"></a>

[LayerZero v2](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-layerzero-v2-076a9b3cb029) introduced Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs), offering tailored security for cross-chain messaging. Any participant can operate their own DVN for interoperability, ensuring the security of their assets and other Canton issued asset transfers and have the ability to establish themselves as a trusted option for other third parties in the Canton network. Alternatively, participants can integrate existing DVNs to optimize cross-chain message verification based on specific requirements such as security, cost, and speed. Over 40 DVNs are currently available, including those operated by Google, Blockdaemon, Polyhedra, LayerZero Labs, and [many others](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/dvn-addresses). There are also adapter DVNs for Chainlink CCIP and other decentralized validation mechanisms if desired.

[Omnichain Fungible Tokens](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/protocol/contract-standards#oft) (OFTs) and [Omnichain Applications](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview) (OApps) leverage LayerZero’s modular security framework, enabling Canton participants to select their own verification methods for token transfers, as the application owner. This flexibility allows application owners to alter verification methods as desired, utilizing oracles, bridges, chain validators, or any suitable verification mechanism.

For further details on DVNs and their functionality, refer to the provided [link](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/modular-security/security-stack-dvns).

#### Pathway Ownership
<a id="pathway-ownership"></a>

As the application owners, Canton participants have full autonomy of [wiring and un-wiring cross-chain pathways](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/create-lz-oapp/wiring) for their applications. The application needs to set peers for the sender application address with each destination LayerZero Endpoint ID and the associated receiver application address. Owners of the contract can turn on and off their [set peers](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#setting-trusted-peers) whenever they want, providing them the ability to connect and disconnect the ability for users to transfer assets and communicate. The LayerZero protocol, nor LayerZero Labs, has any ability to turn on or off an application set peers.

#### Universal Composability
<a id="universal-composability"></a>

OFTs introduce standardization to token operations across various chains. Traditional tokens are often constrained by the rules and standards of their native blockchain, resulting in a fragmented experience when interacting with multiple chains. In contrast, OFTs maintain a consistent standard across all chains they operate on. This uniformity streamlines the user and developer experience, as the token behaves identically regardless of the blockchain used.

Such standardization is invaluable for both developers and users, as it diminishes the complexity and learning curve associated with managing assets across multiple chains. Integration of the OFT Standard can keep token addresses consistent across all chains, simplifying the process for developers and market makers. This feature can significantly reduce the time and resources needed for product managers to incorporate blockchain technology into existing systems.

#### Unified Liquidity
<a id="unified-liquidity"></a>

OFTs unify liquidity across networks through fast and secure communication between contracts via burn and mint (user or application initiated). This eliminates the need for wrapped assets ([4/5 largest exploits have occurred with wrapped assets](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/)) and liquidity on multiple chains for bridging via standalone asset pools, paving the way for scalable liquidity across numerous L2s and L1s. In terms of efficiency, OFTs exist as native tokens on each chain, requiring only gas fees for transfer, devoid of additional costs associated with wrapping, bridging, or slippage. OFTs can be natively transferred across any LayerZero Labs supported chains (currently 124) in a point to point flow, without ever needing to redeem on any one base chain, e.g. Ethereum.

#### Inventory Management
<a id="inventory-management"></a>

OFTs are essential tools for facilitating seamless multi-chain asset management. These tokens enable fast, native transfers across chains, streamlining deposits and withdrawals across any blockchain where they're deployed, eliminating reliance on third-party bridges and reducing settlement times - a critical advantage for effective inventory rebalancing. The unified supply across all chains simplifies the extension to new blockchains, broadening access to diverse ecosystems rapidly, when needed.

Moreover, OFTs optimize liquidity management across different blockchains and exchanges efficiently. The ability to transfer tokens freely negates the necessity for maintaining fragmented inventories across chains. Market makers can centralize their token reserves, deploying them as needed to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities or to provide liquidity, enhancing market stability and efficiency by being able to seamlessly rebalance across chains via burn and mint without having to wait multiple day escrow periods that are inherent to native bridges going to and from L2s.
