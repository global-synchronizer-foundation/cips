## Summary:
This proposal authorizes a one-time allocation of **historical unclaimed rewards** from the Canton validator reward pool to the **Global Synchronizer Foundation (GSF)**. These funds compensate GSF for its critical contributions to the design, governance, and operational stability of the Global Synchronizer.

## Motivation
GSF has played a foundational role in establishing and maintaining the systems that govern the Canton Network, including:

* Launching the legal entity, onboarding founding members, and establishing governance processes for the Global Synchronizer 
* Defining and maintaining long-term technical roadmaps for protocol coordination 
* Structuring pathways for meaningful community engagement and contribution 
* Leading coordination and execution of Super Validator governance and network-wide decision-making


## Scope and Exclusions:
* **Included**: 

    * All **unclaimed** validator rewards **as of the effective date** of this proposal that are **not** explicitly reserved under any approved **milestone-based SV reward schedule**.
    * At time of drafting this note, it is expected that 1.6 to 1.7 billion CC will transfer to the GSF from this action 

* **Excluded**: 

    * Any **future** unclaimed rewards 
    * Rewards currently held in escrow or contractually earmarked for **SV milestone-based delivery**


## Specification: 
* **Recipient**: Global Synchronizer Foundation Treasury (designated on-chain address) 
* **Transfer Mechanism**: One-time disbursement authorized via governance 
* **Reference Date**: Snapshot to be taken at a designated block height or timestamp to establish the reward pool eligible for reallocation

## Actions: 
* IEU to calculate amount of unclaimed rewards to be assigned to the GSF as of a specific block height
* IEU to initiate on-chain process for GSF to mint unclaimed coins when ready
