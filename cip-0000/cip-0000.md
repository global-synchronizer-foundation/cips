==What is a CIP?==

Canton Improvement Proposals for the Global Synchronizer on Canton Network (CIPs) define new operating procedures for the Global Synchronizer, including control of Super Validator rights, governance both on-chain and off-chain, and design specifications for new features for the Splice and Canton software operated by Super Validator and Validator nodes. CIPs may propose changes propose changes to any of these, including configuration settings and code. Software CIPs are limited to changes that would alter the consensus or interoperability among Super Validator nodes and/or Validator nodes. Changes to Canton and Splice software that would not alter conensus or interoperability do not require CIPs. A CIP should provide a concise description and rationale for the change.

CIPs are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting input on an issue from the Global Synchronizer community, and for documenting the design and governance decisions that have gone into the Global Synchronizer. The CIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

Note that CIPs 0001 - 0042 were developed, proposed and accepted or rejected before the CIP process was tracked in GitHub. As a result, the CIP repository records the CIPs as well as email discussions related to their approval by Super Validator rights owners.
