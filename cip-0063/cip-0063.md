## SV Reward Mechanics: 
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in the CIP that granted rights to that Super Validator.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.

##  Appendix I – Motivation

The Canton Network's value and adoption are directly linked to the quantity and quality of data available within its ecosystem.

As institutional adoption grows, there is an increasing need for professional-grade data services that can bridge traditional finance, decentralized ledgers, and real-world use cases.

This integration requires:

1. **Institutional-Grade Data Access**:  
   Financial institutions require standardized, reliable, and compliant data sources to make informed decisions. By integrating Kaiko's enterprise data services, Canton participants gain access to institutional-quality data both on and off-chain.

2. **Cross-Chain Data Availability**:  
   As financial systems become more interconnected, the ability to access verified data from multiple sources becomes critical. Kaiko's integration enables Canton to become a hub for cross-chain and traditional market data.

3. **Data Monetization Opportunities**:  
   Participants in the Canton Network can benefit from new revenue streams by making their data available to Kaiko's client base of financial institutions and market participants.

4. **Enhanced Use Cases**:  
   Many financial applications require external market data to function effectively. By bringing Kaiko's comprehensive data offerings onto Canton, we enable more sophisticated financial applications and use cases.

5. **Market Visibility**:  
   Integration with major institutional data platforms increases the visibility and credibility of the Canton Network among traditional financial institutions.

This proposal creates a mutually beneficial relationship where Kaiko's data expertise enhances the Canton Network's capabilities, while Canton provides Kaiko with a secure, high-performance environment for next-generation financial data services.

## Appendix II – Why Kaiko
Kaiko brings unique advantages to the Canton Network that make it a strong SV candidate:

1. **Established Market Position**:  
   As one of the longest-operating and most trusted cryptocurrency data providers (since 2014), Kaiko brings credibility and institutional relationships that can accelerate Canton's adoption.

2. **Technical Excellence**:  
   Kaiko has built a reputation for data quality, reliability, and coverage that meets the demanding standards of institutional clients. Key technical advantages include:  
   a. Proprietary data cleaning and normalization algorithms  
   b. Advanced market surveillance capabilities  
   c. Millisecond-level trade and order book data  
   d. Comprehensive historical archives dating back to 2014  
   e. SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure

3. **Institutional Relationships**:  
   Kaiko's client base includes top-tier financial institutions, exchanges, and market makers who represent potential Canton Network participants:  
   a. Global banks and investment firms  
   b. Asset managers and hedge funds  
   c. Cryptocurrency exchanges and market makers  
   d. Financial regulators and central banks  
   e. Index providers and ETF issuers

4. **Complementary Capabilities**:  
   Kaiko's focus on data complements the existing strengths of current Super Validators, adding a specialized capability that enhances the overall network value proposition.

5. **Innovation Track Record**:  
   Kaiko has consistently pioneered new data products and market intelligence tools, demonstrating the innovative approach needed to advance the Canton Network ecosystem.

By approving Kaiko as a Super Validator, the Canton Network gains not just a node operator but a strategic partner with the technical capabilities, market position, and vision to drive institutional adoption.
