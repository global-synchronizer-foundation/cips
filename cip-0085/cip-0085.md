## Abstract

This CIP preserves Coin Metrics’ existing Weight 1.0 Super Validator under CIP-0046 and adds an escrowed, outcome-linked maximum earnable Weight of +6.5 for Talos. The incremental weight mints only upon Accountability Subcommittee verification of adoption milestones across:  

* Canton Coin (CC) trading/custody readiness via Talos  
* pX integration to Canton  
* Measured production usage through defined trading and settlement volumes  

## Motivation

The proposal ties incremental SV rewards to real usage and service quality — readiness, live flows, and operational performance — consistent with community precedent. The objective is to broaden CC access through Talos integrations, demonstrate private institutional settlement on Canton (pX), and reward verifiable adoption with outcome-based tranches.  

Rewards are broken down into two key initiatives:  

* Establish Talos platform-wide support for CC across trading (exchange and OTC) and custody integrations. Integrate CC in the Security Master and adapters so order lifecycles, RFQ flows, deposits/withdrawals, and address whitelists work out of the box. Commit to activating CC at any connected venue or custodian within ≤5 business days of their enablement, so clients can use existing workflows without changes.  

* pX is Talos’ stand-alone agency trading desk geared to expedite client onboarding into the crypto ecosystem. It faces upstream exchanges/market makers and downstream institutions, managing credit and post-trade workflows across venues and custodians. pX computes obligations off-chain and would route bilateral settlements through Canton, providing private, confirmed settlement with counterparties—bringing real institutional settlement volume onto Canton and showcasing the network’s privacy and auditability.
