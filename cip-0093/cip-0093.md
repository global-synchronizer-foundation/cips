## Abstract
Bosphorus SV (BSV) will drive user and transaction adoption across Eurasia and the Middle East, focusing on institutional participants transacting in stablecoins, tokenized Treasuries, and other RWAs. BSV’s rewards will be tied to verifiable on-chain burn generated by wallets, apps, and institutions it directly onboards or supports.

BSV will focus on:
- Regional tokenized U.S. Treasury (UST) distribution to financial institutions and treasuries
- Stablecoin settlement and rails for cross border trade and institutional transactions
- Stablecoin wallet, debit, and credit card issuance
- On-chain lending and borrowing applications built on stablecoins and tokenized collaterals
- New tokenized sovereign instruments, including government treasuries
- Cross-border trading between cross-country bonds
- Strategic investment and collaboration with new technology builders and fintech infrastructure projects.

Ari brings policy fluency, operational discipline, and crypto-native product depth to operate secure, compliant, and high-availability validator infrastructure for the Canton Network.

## Motivation
BSV operates in one of the world’s largest digital-asset user bases (Türkiye, GCC, Central Asia) and has existing relationships with banks, PSPs, and fintechs positioned to transact on Canton MainNet.

By anchoring incentives to total burn rather than qualitative milestones, this CIP aligns BSV’s rewards with the network’s real economic activity and ensures direct accountability for usage.

## Proposal
Approve BSV as a Super Validator with max Weight 6, governed under the standard SV framework.

Reward eligibility will be calculated on the total burn attributed to BSV-onboarded entities.

Parties onboarded by BSV will be declared to the Accountability Subcommittee. BSV will be required to track and report on the burn attributable to those entities and the Accountability Subcommittee will confirm those finds.

## SV Commitment
| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Total Canton Coin Burn Attributed** | Sum of CC burned by transactions traceable to activity in US Treasuries, Stablecoins, TRY, and other related assets across BSV-onboarded wallets/apps (excluding CC-related burn) <br><br>If burn after the 12 month period dips > 50% from the average over the reward period, BSV will lose any weight awarded for transaction activity at that point going forward.  | + 12 months from CIP Approval<br><br> | + 0.5 SV Weight per $2m of Inelastic Burn<br><br>Max +5 |
| **Issuance of TRY Government Bonds** | The successful minting of TRY Government bonds with > $10m of TVL held by non-BSV entities| +18 months from CIP Approval| +1|

## SV Reward Mechanics: 
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight. 
    * The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.
