## Mechanics:
<a id="mechanics"></a>

* The GSF Tokenomics committee commits to reviewing each proposed participant and clearly notifying Chainlink if the participant would count against the Adoption Incentives.
* Chainlink will meet with the GSF Tokenomics committee once every 60 days and provide a progress report towards stated deliverables.

### SV Mechanics
<a id="sv-mechanics"></a>

* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in the CIP that granted rights to that Super Validator.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.

* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight

## Appendix I – Motivation
<a id="appendix-i--motivation"></a>

* Enterprise-grade oracle infrastructure for data and cross-chain services is essential for the creation of scalable and compliant institutional use cases on the Canton network. Simultaneously, robust and decentralized oracle architecture is challenging to deliver and scale. 
* The consequences for data and cross-chain infrastructure failures are dire, with broad impact across the dApps, chains, and users involved. Over $2.87B in value has been [exploited from insecure cross-chain infrastructure](https://defillama.com/hacks) to date. Examples include the [Ronin Bridge hack](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60933174) ($600m), [Wormhole bridge hack](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/wormhole-exploit-320m) ($320M), [Nomad bridge hack](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/tech/crypto-bridge-hack-nomad/index.html) ($190M), [Multichain bridge hack](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/multichain-exploit-july-2023/) ($125M), [Cream Finance oracle exploit](https://news.bitcoin.com/cream-finance-suffers-130-million-hack/) ($130M), [Harmony bridge hack](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/hackers-steal-100-million-in-crypto-from-harmonys-horizon-bridge.html) ($100M), which lead to the loss of users funds along with severe [reputational and operational damage](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/05/fantom-seeks-money-back-from-multichains-200m-exploit) for blockchain networks that relied on that infrastructure.  
* Chainlink has an [extensive history](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-banking-capital-markets-announcements/) of working with financial institutions (e.g., [UBS](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-successfully-complete-innovative-pilot-bridge-tokenized-assets-existing-payment-systems), [SBI](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sbi-digital-markets-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-complete-pilot-for-automated-fund-administration-and-transfer-agency-using-smart-contracts-302307816.html), [Swift](https://blog.chain.link/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/results_report_swift_interoperability_experiments_final_310823-2.pdf), [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/DTCC-Connection/Smart_NAV-Report.pdf), and many more covered below) to support their blockchain adoption strategies. This includes building custom data and interoperability solutions, defining unique business use cases, building smart contracts to enable core functionalities, and enabling the creation of complex transactions ready for a production environment.
* Chainlink's robust infrastructure and extensive expertise significantly reduce the complexity and cost for TradFi institutions to engage with blockchain technologies (public or private) and transact with counterparties who are integrated with our platform in a compatible way, leveraging our privacy and compliance tooling suites critical for institutional-grade transactions. Chainlink’s highly secure and reliable [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://chain.link/cross-chain)  accelerates the composability and connectivity of fragmented liquidity across public and private blockchains by enabling the flow of data and value between networks. 
* Chainlink CCIP enables digital assets issued by financial institutions on other blockchains to move into the Canton network, while also supporting Canton as a launch point for new assets that can flow into other chain ecosystems where demand exists
* Chainlink proposes bringing a unique three-part value proposition to the Canton Network. This consists of:
    * Enabling current Canton users to implement use cases that require data oracles (such as proof of reserves) and/or cross-chain interoperability infrastructure; **seven have been identified thus far. The first use case will use PoR to support bridged collateral into the Canton Network using Bitcoin (wrapped iBTC).**
    * Using CCIP to connect the Canton Network Global Synchronizer with over 50 public and permissioned blockchains, at the highest levels of security and reliability.
    * Working with SBI Digital Markets to create a Canton Network on/off ramp for regulated digital assets, enabling the secure movement of such assets across jurisdictional boundaries and in accordance with regulatory requirements.

## Appendix II – Why Chainlink?
<a id="appendix-ii--why-chainlink"></a>

2. **Chainlink offers a full suite of services on its platform at the intersection of DeFi and Traditional Finance**

![alt_text](/cip-0061/cip-0061-fig-1.png)

 * **Chainlink serves as a unified developer platform that provides all of the core services required to build advanced blockchain applications**, including secure access to real-world data, seamless cross-chain interoperability, verifiable offchain compute, and connectivity to existing legacy systems. Rather than combining a disjointed collection of various services from different vendors with varying security guarantees—which introduces significant complexity, higher costs, and increased developer friction—developers can instead simply compose multiple Chainlink services together through a [programmable runtime environment](https://blog.chain.link/introducing-chainlink-runtime-environment/) to meet their unique use cases, while retaining the highest level of security and reliability. 
* **Onchain Oracle Data:**
    * **Push-Based Data Feeds** provide financial market data and are widely adopted by lending protocols such as Aave, Compound, Spark, along with hundreds of DeFi applications, opening chains to a diverse community of financial applications. 
    * **Pull-Based Data Streams & DataLink** provide low-latency, sub-second market data for tens of thousands of assets, supporting high-frequency DeFi applications such as derivative markets like GMX.
    * **[Proof of Reserve ](https://chain.link/education-hub/proof-of-reserves)(PoR)** provides transparency into the offchain or cross-chain reserves backing tokenized assets, wrapped tokens, and cross-chain assets, enabling secure minting use cases where tokens can only be minted if sufficient collateral has been verified.
    * **Net Asset Value (NAV) **data is crucial to ensure accurate valuations of underlying funds and Chainlink is the only decentralised oracle platform offering NAV feeds supporting top-tier fund managers/administrators such as Fidelity International, APEX, and other key teams. This NAV data opens chains to securely integrate institutional-grade assets, providing greater transparency, reducing counterparty risk, and expanding access to liquidity pools traditionally reserved for institutional investors. 
* **Connectivity with off-chain systems:**
    * **[Chainlink and Swift](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-unlocks-potential-tokenisation-successful-blockchain-experiments)** have been working together for 7+ years and recently developed a landmark solution enabling financial institutions to re-use their existing Swift infrastructure and financial messaging standards to trigger transactions across any public or private blockchain network. Connectors with other off-chain systems are under development.
    * **[Chainlink Runtime Environment](https://blog.chain.link/introducing-chainlink-runtime-environment/) (CRE)** provides a secure offchain computing environment for coordinating activity across blockchains and existing systems. Complex transactions take the form of programmable workflows that can compose multiple Chainlink services together while enabling the transfer of data and value between any onchain or offchain system.  
    * **[Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol](https://chain.link/cross-chain) (CCIP)** provides an unmatched level of security for cross-chain data and value transfer.
3. **Chainlink provides unparalleled security and reliability**
 * Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks (DONs) have provided the highest level of security and reliability even in the most extreme market events (e.g., 2020 Covid Crash, 2022 FTX and Terra collapses, 2025 ByBit hack, etc) since Chainlink’s mainnet launch in 2019. 
* Chainlink’s unmatched security and reliability has enabled users to truly scale across the data oracle (Data Feeds / Data Streams), cross-chain messaging (CCIP), and offchain computation stack. Chainlink’s reputation of prioritizing security without compromise can help ensure that the largest TradFi institutions in the world have the confidence required to deploy assets on chain. 
     * The [Five Levels of Cross-Chain Security](https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/) outlines a framework for evaluating the security of cross-chain messaging protocols and highlights the key risks. **Chainlink CCIP operates at the fifth and highest level of security by using a Defense-in-Depth approach and multiple decentralized oracle networks built on the industry’s most battle-tested oracle infrastructure** ($20T+ in TVE & $75B in peak TVS), along with 24/7 risk monitoring, an independent Risk Management Network, granular transfer rate limits, and more ensuring the most secure and resilient infrastructure on the market. 
* **Chainlink continues to enhance CCIP to meet the needs of regulated financial markets**, this includes:
    * The recent launch of the [Chainlink Platform Privacy Suite.](https://blog.chain.link/ccip-private-transactions-blockchain-privacy-manager/) This allows institutions to integrate their private blockchain networks with existing systems, such as traditional enterprise backends, while limiting onchain data exposure. In addition, it leverages a novel onchain encryption/decryption protocol to enable institutions to transact across multiple private blockchains using the public CCIP network, while keeping the transaction details fully confidential.
    * The upcoming launch of the **Chainlink Compliance Service**, an interoperable smart contract toolkit that connects real-world identity and compliance data with on-chain financial systems, enabling complex financial transactions across multiple jurisdictions. It can be used to define and enforce compliance transactional policies at the organisational, jurisdictional or global level without the need for a single owner/operator. The compliance service enables institutions to engage with a composable framework for setting up, managing, and reporting compliance requirements for digital assets across any public and private blockchain networks. It also enables the configuration of policies and rules, the management of investor identities, and the enforcement of compliance controls. Asset issuers can define transaction conditions, verify their fulfillment, and provide proof of enforcement to regulatory bodies.

## Appendix III - Chainlink’s Scope of Work — A Snapshot
<a id="appendix-iii--chainlinks-scope-of-work----a-snapshot"></a>

Beyond our industry leading activity in Web3, Chainlink is [actively working with some of the world’s largest financial institutions](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-banking-capital-markets-announcements/) (e.g., Swift, DTCC, UBS, SBI, State Street, detailed below), helping them define their business use case strategies, building smart contracts for core capabilities and enabling them to actively bring these complex systems onchain into production. Our focus is on powering their progress in adopting blockchain technology. 

Through this work, we have obtained a deep understanding of the intricacies related to banking and capital markets within traditional finance, including the immense complexity they need to handle to deliver intricate transaction flows engaging numerous counterparties, vast amounts of data, and deeply entrenched legacy systems.
