## Abstract

This CIP proposes awarding up to Weight 10 for onboarding Mesh (global payments network for stablecoins and cryptoassets) to Canton MainNet, with rewards tied to (i) successful integration, (ii) earlier readiness (time-based acceleration), and (iii) on-chain adoption.

- **+2** for completing a production-ready Canton Implementation within 180 days.
- **Up to +2** acceleration if Production readiness occurs as early as Day 60 (linear down to 0 at Day 180).
- **Up to +3** adoption bonus at **+0.5 per $500M** notional transacted on Canton (cap +3).
- **Up to +3** adoption bonus at **+0.5 per $1B** notional transacted on Canton (cap +3).

## Motivation

Mesh's crypto payment infrastructure connects 400+ million users across 300+ wallets/exchanges with seamless crypto-to-stablecoin settlement. Native integration with Canton is expected to:

- Establish a cornerstone for payment flows on Canton by bridging retail crypto liquidity ($3T market) with Canton's $6T+ tokenized assets through consumer-friendly rails.
- Mobilize major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, PYUSD) throughout the Canton ecosystem, enabling atomic settlement between any crypto asset and compliant tokenized assets.
- Provide critical infrastructure for institutional payment companies to leverage their existing Mesh integration for Canton participation, accelerating enterprise adoption.

## Specification (updated)

| # | Milestone | Scope (what must be true) | Target window | Weight (base → max) | Acceptance / Evidence (TWG-verifiable) |
|---|----------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| D1 | Mesh Payment Network Production Canton Integration | Mesh able to mobilize Canton Token Standard assets to/from Canton MainNet in production environment, and has processed a minimum of $10M of total customer transaction volume.  Mesh has published a press release announcing the integration and designating Canton Network as Mesh's preferred “Privacy Chain”. | ≤ Day 180 from CIP approval | +2.0 | Txn ID’s verifying a minimum of $10M of customer activity across Canton Mainnet |
| D1a | Production Integration — Time Acceleration | Earlier production readiness. Linear reward between Day 60 and Day 180. | Day 60 → Day 180 | 0.0 → +2.0 | Formula: `Accel_bridged = max(0, min(1, (180 − d) / 120)) × 2.0`, where `d` = days from approval to D1 acceptance (timestamped by Tokenomics Working Group). |
| D2 | Adoption Bonus - Notional Based Volume | Mesh facilitates notional volume transacted on Canton counted once per obligation; exclude wash/loopbacks; methodology disclosed. | 12 months starting on the effective date of D1 completion | 0.0 → +3.0 | +0.5 per $500M verified Mesh enabled notional (cap +3.0 ⇒ $3B). Evidence: monthly attestation (data sources) + sampled TXIDs. |
| D3 | Adoption Bonus - Notional Based Volume | Mesh facilitates notional volume transacted on Canton counted once per obligation; exclude wash/loopbacks; methodology disclosed. | 12 months from completion of D2 or 24 months from completion of D1 | 0.0 → +3.0 | +0.5 per $1B verified Mesh enabled notional (cap +3.0 ⇒ $6B). Evidence: monthly attestation (data sources) + sampled TXIDs. |

### SV Reward Mechanics

- An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the Foundation, or another SV node operator approved to provide SV rewards escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight.
  - The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the SV node.
  - The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV.
  - The escrow SV will **NOT** mint rewards on a block by block basis.
  - All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool.
- ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow the escrowing SV node to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator.
- Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group.
  - Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone.
- If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.
  - The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator.
  - ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics Working Group.
- If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:
  - Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF.
  - Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
  - The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards.
- Applicant is subject to **CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements**.
  - If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight, provided the network has capacity to onboard this SV. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.

## Rationale

- **Outcome-linked incentives**: Rewards are tied to real delivery (production) and real usage (adoption), aligning emissions with network value.
- **Time-value of readiness**: A steep acceleration for earlier delivery recognizes the outsized ecosystem impact of having Mesh enabling payment flows as soon as possible on Canton.
- **Simple adoption metric**: A transparent $-notional count encourages broad usage across venues and apps without dictating product design.
