## Summary

This CIP establishes an umbrella, milestone-based program through which YZi Labs can receive SV Weight
(up to 10) for initiatives that materially advance the Canton ecosystem.

Unlike single-purpose CIPs, this program is open-ended so YZi can be opportunistic—prioritizing what the
network needs most at any given time—while preserving accountability via pre-approval and objective
milestone verification.

* **Total Earnable Weight:** 10 (max)  
* **Term:** +365 Days from CIP Approval  
* **Accrual Destination:** Escrow, consistent with existing SV escrow mechanics.  
* **Confidentiality:** The Committee may approve confidential initiatives with YZi.

## Motivation

YZi Labs is an investment vehicle managing over $10 billion in assets globally, with a  portfolio that spans
more than 300 projects across 25 countries on six continents. YZi Labs invests at every stage, with a focus
on projects in Web3, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.

The firm’s investment philosophy emphasizes impact first, based on the belief that meaningful returns follow
from ventures delivering long-term value. 

YZi intends to make a serious, flexible commitment to Canton: driving portfolio adoption and investing early
around the network. Given the breadth of their footprint, rigid, one-off CIPs are a poor fit. The community,
however, rightly expects milestone-based accountability. This program balances both.

* **Flexible, not vague:** YZi can pivot to the network’s highest-leverage needs without returning for a 
new CIP each time.
* **Milestone-based:** Every credited unit of Weight maps to pre-approved, defined outcomes.
* **Confidentiality when needed:** Supports sensitive partner negotiations
* C**onsistent accountability:** Credits flow to escrow using the same SV mechanics the community 
already understands.

## Scope & Example Outcomes

Initiatives may include (non-exhaustive):

* **Adoption:** Launch key products on Canton, integrations, migrations.
* **Ecosystem Investment**: Anchor investments in early Canton startups, accelerators, or shared 
services.
* **Infrastructure & Tooling:** Wallets, SDKs, data pipelines, monitoring, compliance tooling.
* **Liquidity & Access:** DEXs, market infrastructure, etc.

## Program Mechanics

### 4.1 Pre-Approval (Per-Initiative)

Before YZi begins work it intends to claim Weight for, it must obtain pre-approval from the Tokenomics
Committee specifying:

1. **Target Outcomes** (objective, measurable; e.g., go-live date, integrations, KPIs)  
2. **Evidence Requirements** (artifacts, on-chain proofs, attestations, URLs)  
3. **Timeline** (milestones, due dates)  
4. **Assigned Weight** (total and per-milestone tranches)  
5. **Verification Process** (who checks what, how, by when)  
6. **Confidentiality Flag** (Y/N; if Y, include a redacted public summary)  

**Committee duty:** respond with clear Weight and conditions (acceptance tests) so YZi knows
exactly how Weight will be earned.

### 4.2 Verification & Credit

* **Submission:** Upon milestone completion, YZi submits evidence per the pre-approved checklist.  
* **Review:** The Committee verifies within a reasonable window.  
* **Credit:** Verified Weight is transferred from escrow; any unverified portion remains pending.  

Where counterparties or market sensitivities require it, the Committee and YZi may maintain
confidential terms.

### 4.3 Double counting protection

Where YZi is earning SV Weight for bringing something to the Network, the entity joining may not also 
apply for SV Weight to incentivize integration.

Once live and active, the referred entity can apply for SV Weight where above and beyond integrating 
and activating their initial users. 

## SV Mechanics

* A ‘representative’ SV will be setup by the GSF, or other Super Validator node operator approved to offer escrow services, with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in 
this CIP
* The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the representative SV
* The representative SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
* All representative SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool

Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working 
Group

Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for 
meeting the requirements of the milestone

If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, 
an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List

⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be 
minted by the Applicant’s Validator  
⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow Applicant to takeover 
a portion of their SV Weight on a go-forward basis  

If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline:  
* Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF  
* Remaining SV Weight on the representative SV will be removed from the SV Operator configs  
* The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the 
Unclaimed Rewards
