## Abstract

* Add LECCA Ventures as a Tier-3 (Weight 1) Super Validator.
* Activate Korea-based banks and securities firms via local onboarding, KR-language operations, regulatory guidance, and validator hosting.
* Stand up Validator-as-a-Service for Korean institutions within 6 months, and publish Korean-language blueprints/runbooks.
* Onboarding targets: ≥1 KR institutional validator activated on mainnet by 2025-12-31; ≥2 in total by 2026-06-30; monthly progress notes.
* Any increase beyond Weight 1 will be proposed via a separate Adjust Weight CIP.

## Motivation

* LECCA Ventures has conducted one-to-one engagements with the right decision-makers at 10+ Korean banks and securities firms; detailed institution lists can be shared privately with sponsors and endorsers.
* Korea is one of the most active digital-asset markets; policy momentum around stablecoins and tokenized securities (STO) creates a near-term adoption window.
* Korean banks and securities firms request production-grade implementation blueprints and runbooks, clear roles/commercial model, and references beyond repo/bonds (e.g., cross-border settlement, supply-chain financing, corporate FX and stablecoin settlement).
* A Seoul-based operator with local language and time-zone coverage reduces time-to-activation for Korea-based institutions.

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| KR Institutional Validator-as-a-Service (VaaS) | Korean-language blueprints/runbooks; IaC templates for validator deployment/hardening; observability dashboards and alert rules (Prometheus/Grafana); onboarding checks/CLI; managed ops for pilots | VaaS toolkit within 6 months post-approval; >= 1 activation by 2025-12-31; >= 2 total by 2026-06-30 |
