## Abstract

* Add LECCA Ventures, a crypto-native VC in Korea, as an SV of Weight 1
* Facilitate participation of Korean banks and securities firms through localized onboarding, Korean-language operations, regulatory guidance, and validator hosting.
* Establish a Validator-as-a-Service offering for Korean institutions within 6 months, and publish supporting blueprints and runbooks in Korean.
* Achieve onboarding of at least one Korean financial institution to mainnet by 180 days from CIP approval.
* Note, any increase beyond Weight 1 will be proposed via a separate Adjust Weight CIP.

## Motivation

* LECCA Ventures has already engaged one-on-one with key decision-makers at 10+ Korean banks and securities firms; a detailed institution list can be shared separately with sponsors and endorsers.
* Korea is one of the most active digital-asset markets, with regulatory momentum around stablecoins and tokenized securities (STO) creating a near-term window for adoption.
* Korean institutions are actively seeking production-grade implementation blueprints and runbooks, a clear commercial model with defined roles, and proven use cases beyond repos and bonds (e.g., cross-border settlement, supply-chain financing, corporate FX, and stablecoin settlement).
* LECCA, a Seoul-based operator, offering local language and time-zone coverage materially reduces time-to-activation for Korean institutions.

## Rationale

* LECCA Ventures is a Seoul-based, crypto-native venture firm with an in-house validator operations arm.
* Starting at Weight 1 is appropriate for an entry SV focused on Korean institutional onboarding and operations, with any increase to be proposed through an Adjust Weight CIP based on demonstrated deliverables and successful onboardings.
