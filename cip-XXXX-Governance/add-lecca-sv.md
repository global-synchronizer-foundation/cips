## Abstract

* Add LECCA Ventures as a Tier-3 (Weight 1) Super Validator.
* Activate Korea-based banks and securities firms via local onboarding, Korean-language operations, regulatory guidance, and validator hosting.
* Stand up Validator-as-a-Service for Korean institutions within 6 months, and publish Korean-language blueprints/runbooks.
* Targets: ≥1 Korean financial institution onboarded to mainnet by T+90; ≥2 in total by T+270; monthly progress notes.
* Any increase beyond Weight 1 will be proposed via a separate Adjust Weight CIP.

## Motivation

* LECCA Ventures has conducted one-to-one engagements with the right decision-makers at 10+ Korean banks and securities firms; detailed institution lists can be shared privately with sponsors and endorsers.
* Korea is one of the most active digital-asset markets; policy momentum around stablecoins and tokenized securities (STO) creates a near-term adoption window.
* Korean banks and securities firms request production-grade implementation blueprints and runbooks, clear roles/commercial model, and references beyond repo/bonds (e.g., cross-border settlement, supply-chain financing, corporate FX and stablecoin settlement).
* A Seoul-based operator with local language and time-zone coverage reduces time-to-activation for Korea-based institutions.

## Rationale

* LECCA is a Seoul‑based crypto‑native venture firm with an in‑house validator operations arm.
* Starting at Weight 1 is appropriate for an entry SV focused on Korean institutional onboarding and operations, with any increase to be proposed later via an Adjust Weight CIP based on delivered artifacts and onboardings.
