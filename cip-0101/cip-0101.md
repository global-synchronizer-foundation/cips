## Abstract

Add Finoa as a Super Validator (SV) of Weight 3.

## About the Applicant

Finoa is a leading European Union digital asset infrastructure provider headquartered in Berlin, Germany.  
Founded in 2018, Finoa delivers institutional-grade custody, staking, and network participation services to a global client base that includes banks, investment funds, asset managers, and Web3 foundations, and is backed by leading financial investors such as Balderton and Santander Bank (Mouro Capital).

**Key Highlights:**

- Serving high-profile institutional clients across the globe  
- Supporting 100+ digital assets and operating over 10,000 deployed nodes  
- Proven operational excellence in validator infrastructure, currently managing 10 active validators on the Canton Network, with 5 additional validator slots approved  
- Developing two Canton Featured Apps, Tokino & Vala Wallet  
- Recognized for secure, compliant, and transparent infrastructure, with a strong focus on operational reliability and institutional-grade risk management  

## Motivation

### Finoa’s Role within the Canton Network

Finoa is already an institutional infrastructure partner to the Canton Network, serving Tier-1 institutions such as Börse Stuttgart, Bank Frick, Tradias, Blockchain.com, and Centrifuge as a Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) operator. These institutions require a regulated custodian not only to hold the Canton Coin rewards generated via their validators, but also to custody and monetise the on-chain financial products they issue or distribute on Canton.

In parallel, Finoa is in active discussions with tokenisation platforms issuing on Canton (such as SG Forge and Black Manta), as well as stablecoin issuers, to serve as a custody and infrastructure provider for them and their end-clients. Over time, Finoa’s goal is to expand its role from being an infrastructure provider to becoming a distribution and platform partner for Canton-based tokenised products—offering these instruments, and their associated financial use cases, directly to Finoa’s institutional customer base.

To realise this strategy and deepen its impact on the Canton ecosystem as a Super Validator, Finoa commits to implementing the following phased roadmap.

## Rationale

### Roadmap Enabled by Super Validator Status

#### Phase 1 – Custody Integration

Finoa will expand its regulated institutional custody platform to fully support Canton-native assets and tokenised instruments, including stablecoins, issued on the Canton Network.

**Scope:**

- Add Canton Coin and assets issued under the Canton Token Standard as supported assets within Finoa’s custody platform so they can be held, serviced, and accounted for alongside clients’ existing digital asset portfolios  
- Provide clients with full portfolio visibility and controls for their Canton positions—including balances, transaction history, and reconciliations—integrated into Finoa’s existing reporting and operations stack  
- Act as the regulated safekeeping venue for tokenised instruments issued on Canton, including products from tokenisation platforms, giving their end-clients a compliant place to hold and manage these assets  
- Implement custody workflows such as escrow arrangements, managed lock-up and vesting schedules, collateral pledging, and other secured holding structures for Canton-native and tokenised assets, enabling use cases like secured lending, repo, and structured products  

**Outcome:**

- Tier-1 validator clients & institutional clients have a regulated, institutional-grade venue to hold Canton rewards and Canton-based tokenised assets  
- Finoa will deepen partnerships with validator clients such as Börse Stuttgart, Bank Frick, and others by:  
  - Offering custody for Canton-based products originated by these validator clients to Finoa’s institutional clients  
  - Providing Finoa custody as an option for validator clients’ end-customers who wish to hold Canton-related products in a regulated environment  
- Where Finoa provides custody for Canton-based tokenised products, these assets can be used in institutional workflows, including serving as collateral in financing structures (e.g. secured lending, repo, or other credit arrangements), subject to applicable risk and compliance frameworks  

---

#### Phase 2 – On/Off-Ramp Connectivity

Finoa will link Canton-native assets and tokenised products to its broader funding and trading channels, making it straightforward for institutions to deploy and adjust capital in Canton-based exposures.

**Scope:**

- Work with Finoa’s existing payment partners so that institutional clients can fund and withdraw Canton Coin and selected Canton-linked stablecoins via supported fiat rails  
- Connect to liquidity and brokerage partners to enable buying and selling of Canton-based tokenised assets, where permitted by regulation and demand  
- Set up operational workflows that allow clients to subscribe, redeem, and rebalance positions in Canton-native and tokenised products held under Finoa’s custody  
- Align movements between custody accounts, funding channels, and Canton validator wallets to enable efficient capital movement between off-chain and on-chain environments  

**Outcome:**

- Institutional clients can enter, adjust, and exit Canton exposures using familiar funding and trading channels, reducing friction to adopt Canton-based assets  

---

#### Phase 3 – Yield Infrastructure

Finoa will integrate Canton-native yield avenues into its custody platform, enabling institutional clients to earn on-chain yield on Canton Coin & Canton-issued assets while keeping assets under regulated custody.

**Scope:**

- Offer Tokino and other approved on-chain yield opportunities through Finoa’s custody platform  
- Provide full lifecycle support for allocating, monitoring, and redeeming yield positions directly from custody  
- Expand the yield menu to include additional yield-bearing Canton-native assets and structures  
- Offer tCC liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens representing claims on Canton Coin committed to Tokino  
- Collaborate with tokenisation platforms and ecosystem partners to ensure safe custody and reporting of yield products  

**Outcome:**

- Institutional clients gain access to curated on-chain yield options managed entirely within custody  
- Yield positions integrate into institutional workflows including risk, collateral, and reporting processes  

---

#### Phase 4 – Distribution & Tokenised Product Access

Finoa will act as a distribution partner for Canton-based tokenised products.

**Scope:**

- Establish direct distribution relationships with tokenisation platforms  
- Onboard institutional investors using Finoa’s existing KYC, risk, and suitability processes  
- Aggregate institutional demand and present signals to tokenisation platforms  
- Facilitate primary subscriptions and settlement within custody accounts  
- Support lifecycle events such as income distributions, redemptions, and reporting  

**Outcome:**

- Institutional capital is directed into Canton-native issuances  
- Tokenisation platforms benefit from aggregated, qualified demand and end-to-end servicing
